- 👋 Hi, my name is Kaeden Wodke! 
- 👀 My goal is to get to a point of digital language proficiency that I can write my own videogames! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics through the UO coding bootcamp.
- 💞️ I'm always open to collaboration as that is the best way to come up with new, innovative ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me: the best way to reach me will be on the slack channel but an email is also good kaedenthewodke@gmail.com
