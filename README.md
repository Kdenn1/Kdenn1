- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kdenn1
- 👀 I’m interested in making coding a career
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics through the UO coding bootcamp however I have fairly good knowledge of css and html5 already
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on app ideas and development (let's make a bag and split it 70/30)
- 📫 How to reach me: the best way to reach me will be on the slack channel but an email is also okay kaedenthewodke@gmail.com
